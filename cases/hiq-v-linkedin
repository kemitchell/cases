quotes:
  - If companies like LinkedIn, whose servers hold vast amounts of public data, are permitted selectively to ban only potential competitors from accessing and using that otherwise public data, the result---complete exclusion of the original innovator in aggregating and analyzing the public information---may well be considered unfair competition under California law.
  - In sum, Nosal II and Poewr Ventures control situations in which authorization generally is required and has either never been given or has been revoked.
holdings:
  - upheld preliminary injunction
